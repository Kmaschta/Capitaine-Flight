# Capitaine Flight

## What was that ?
I've created a single-page website at www.capitaineflight.tk which faked a platform for buying flight ticket totally copied from [Captain Train](https://www.captaintrain.com).
In fact, it was a screenshot of the homepage of Captain Train slightly modified.

## Why was that ?
A travel Nancy - Toulouse I had to do at the end of month forced me to spend a few hours looking for the cheapest ticket whereas Captain Train got me a ticket Nancy - Marseille for less than hundred euros in three seconds.

We are in 2015, there is now a place for a "Captain Flight", or simply an intuitive platform, pleasant to use, for compare the tickets offered by all airlines.

I guess it is not easy to do, but it was enough to motivate me to throw this bottle into the internet-ocean.

## Ending / Conclusion
It was a frustration's whimper.

But it happened to the ears of [Jean-Daniel Guyot, CEO of Captain Train, who proposed to keep an eye on « Misterfly »](https://twitter.com/jdguyot/status/638631771937075200) (that was in beta at that moment).


Again, I'm sorry if I disturbed some people, especially at Capitain Train (because I love your work, I use it everyday).

The site is now stopped, I let this 30 lines here posthumously and I'll stay on the lookout for a great solution.
If you know one, feel free to ping me.
